	If you think you already have an Omniauth pure account, and you were just trying to associate a new authentication with your existing account, then you’re in the wrong place. You’re not logged into Omniauth pure right now.

		If you already have an Abirds account, and you’d like to associate another authentication with it, here’s what to do:
	</p>
	<ul class="small">
		<li>Log in in to Abirds with your existing authentication service.</li>
		<li>Go to your settings page (located at the top right corner of the page).</li>
		<li>Add one or more accounts to be used to sign-in.</li>
	</ul>
